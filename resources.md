☛ [Matrix calculus](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/): a page that introduces how to do matrix calculus (from basic derivatives to the use of chain rules, etc). Designed for a machine learning audience. For simple definitions that are more basic and concise, the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus#Derivatives_with_vectors) entry is helpful too. 

☛ [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/): a page explaining LSTM without requiring too much math. However, to understand how this really works, it's recommended to actually go through the math.
