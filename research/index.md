I'm broadly interested in aspects of language modeling, and in particularly speech perception and learning. My major undergraduate research is divided into two themes: 

First, I worked on accented speech perception and adaptation. In this part, I actively contributed towards building a <a href="Li_Xie_Jaeger_AMLaP2018_poster.pdf">speech corpus of Mandarin-accented English</a>. We then used the corpus for modeling of ideal adaptor mechanisms. 

Secondly, I worked on infant speech learning from modeling approaches. In this work, I used <a href="YFRSW_abstract_LL.pdf">models that train directly on raw speech to model infants' learning environments</a>. In my (ongoing) honors thesis, I am connecting phonetic learning to sound sequence learning, and examining whether and whether and how these two learning processes interact.

## Interesting semester papers/projects (a selection)

<a href="LIN210_projectPaper_LL.pdf">Phonology of Kunming Chinese</a> is a semester project that I did for my phonetics/phonology course, LIN210. I was very happy to study the phonology of my hometown dialect, of which I am a passive native speaker!

I also took a year-long research course in my junior year. In the later half of the research, I submitted an <a href="BCS207_abstractExpo_LL.pdf">abstract</a> and presented a <a href="Expo_poster_LL.pdf">poster</a> at the Undergraduate Research expo at my university. At the end of the work, I also presented a 20-min <a href="BCS207_finalPresentation_LL.pdf">final presentation</a> and wrote up a 10-page <a href="BCS207_finalPaper_LL.pdf">paper</a>.
