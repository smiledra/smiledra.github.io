Broadly, I am interested in how human perception can be modeled, and have mostly been focused on the auditory domain. Speech is something we perceive and use effortlessly but is nontrivial to machine learning. With decades of efforts, speech processing in ML still encounters difficulty in low-resource and noisy scenarios. In my PhD, I study speech processing (in machines) and auditory perception (in humans) and how we can use advances in one to inform the other.

In my [MS paper](/research/MSCS_ScholarlyPaper_Final.pdf) in Computer Science, I use differentiability to bring auditory neuroscience models into deep learning frameworks. In other words, I implement neuroscience models in signal processing steps so that parameters along the way can be updated through back-propagation, allowing physics-based models to be used in part of the deep learning pipeline.

In a [PhD project](/research/languagediscrimination_0131.pdf) in Cognitive Science, I use various machine learning models to simulate human behavior of distinguishing between certain languages and not others, and revealed that temporal regularities are not important to any of the machine learning models -- and therefore may not be relevant in driving the human behavior either.

As an undergrad, I was involved in a project using machine learning models to study early phonetic learning. I led the investigation of training models under varying input conditions in a [audiobook corpus](https://github.com/smiledra/audiobook) I constructed, and found that models trained on unevenly distributed speaker --- perhaps more similar to infants' learning environments --- do not generalize well to new settings. This work was [presented](CogSci2020.pdf) in CogSci 2020.

I also actively contributed towards building a speech corpus of Mandarin-accented English. The corpus contains speech of native American English and Mandarin-Accented English, with both isolated words and connected speech. A preliminary report of the corpus can be found [here](Li_Xie_Jaeger_AMLaP2018_corpus.pdf). I also learned to use (Bayesian) ideal adaptor models to model a listener's adaptation to such accent using this corpus data.
