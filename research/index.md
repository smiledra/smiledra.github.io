I'm broadly interested in how the human brain perceives and processes information. Currently in my PhD, I study this through speech rhythm --- temporal regularities and patterns of how syllables are organized. Some specific questions I am interested in exploring are how speech rhythm is represented in cognition, how it is learned by infants during the first few months of their lives, and how the learned representation of rhythm can interact when we learn a novel language of different rhythm structure.

Furthermore, temporal regularities in sequential information is not unique to speech. As such, I am also interested in how the brain parses other temporal regularities, and if speech differ from them. For example, in my [first-year project](CCN2022_Li_et_al_Final.pdf), I explored how a model inspired by music rhythm processing can be applied to speech rhythm.

Before working on speech rhythm, I was also involved in a project of early phonetic learning, where machine learning models are employed to simulate the learning outcome of unsupervised learning of phonetic representations in infants. I tested the model under varying input conditions in a [audiobook corpus](https://github.com/smiledra/audiobook) I constructed, and found that models trained on unevenly distributed speaker --- perhaps more similar to infants' learning environments --- do not generalize so well. This work was [presented](CogSci2020.pdf) in CogSci 2020.

I also actively contributed towards building a speech corpus of Mandarin-accented English. The corpus contains speech of native American English and Mandarin-Accented English, with both isolated words and connected speech. A preliminary report of the corpus can be found [here](Li_Xie_Jaeger_AMLaP2018_corpus.pdf). I also learned to use (Bayesian) ideal adaptor models to model a listener's adaptation to such accent using this corpus data.
