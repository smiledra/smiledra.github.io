    <p>The notes below are based on an introductory course I took on Linguistics during my first year in college. I appreciate Prof. Maya Abtahian for having taught a great course.</p>

<h2 id="linguistics">Linguistics</h2>

<p><strong>Linguistics</strong> is the study of human language.</p>

<p><strong>Prescriptive Grammar</strong> (<strong>split of infinitives</strong> (e.g. to boldly go), <strong>preposition stranding</strong> (e.g. who did you go with / with whom did you go?) , difference in dialects/individuals, using “I shall” and “you will”; what a language should be)</p>

<p><strong>Descriptive Grammar</strong> (Grammatical / Ungrammatical (wouldn’t make any sense / be understood), what a language is about)</p>

<p><strong>Noam Chomsky</strong>: <strong>universal grammar</strong> - proposes the innateness of language (almost every sentence is new and never seen before; children can acquire language easily)</p>

<h3 id="general-nature-of-language">General nature of language</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Arbitrariness</strong> (symbolic nature of morphemes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Displacement</strong> (meanings are displaced from the presence) past/future tense, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Creativity</strong> (Openess &amp; Recursion (in word “nationalization”; in phrases - X→XP - small phrases can be embedded within big ones,
infinetly))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Duality</strong> (meaningless parts create meaningful whole)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Grammaticality / rule-governed</strong> (governed by strict rules)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cultural Transmission</strong> (different languages in different region, and need to be learned)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uniquely human (only human)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Universal (all human)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every language (dialect) is complex, systematic and has variation</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h2 id="phonology">Phonology</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Phoneme inventory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Phonological rules</strong> (underlying/basic form (the basic allophone, e.g. [i]) → derived/restricted form (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[íː]</code> in “bead”)) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x → y / _z</code> (x - class of sound; y - feature that changes; z - environment)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phonotactics: Syllable [onset, rhyme[nucleus, coda]] e.g. lin, n is a coda</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most languages are based on <strong>pulmonic egressive airstream</strong>, created by compression of lung. (Other two: glottalic/velaric ejective/implosive)</p>

<p>4 <strong>Articulators</strong>: laryngeal, dorsal, coronal, labial</p>

<p>8 <strong>Places of Articulation</strong>: glottal, pharyngeal, uvular(French “r”), velar, palatal, alveolar, dental, labial</p>

<p><strong>Manners of Articulation</strong>: stop, fricative, affricative, nasal, approximant (glide, i.e. semi-vowels)</p>

<p><strong>Obstruents</strong> (stops, affricates, fricatives) vs. <strong>Sonorants</strong> (nasal stops, approximants, vowels)</p>

<p>Suprasegmental qualities / prosodies: length, stress and pitch</p>

<p>Consonant inventories - English is in “average”; Vowel quality inventories - English belongs to “large (7–14)” </p>

<p>The number of consonants in the world’s languages ranges from roughly 6 to 122.</p>

<p>The number of vowels in the world’s languages ranges from roughly 2 to 14. </p>

<p>Phonological processes: (<strong>Natural sound change - looks like some of the phonological rules</strong>)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Assimilation (octo → otto)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dissimilation - either synchronic or diachronic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lenition/fortition (amica → amiga/amie)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deletion (word final [ə] in nose becomes dropped)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insertion (athlete insertion of a [ə] after [θ])</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metathesis (reversal of segments) (periculum → peligro)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diphthongization/monophthongization ([iː]→[ɑɪ] in “ice”; [ɪʊ]→[u] in “rude”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Raising, lowering, fronting and backing of vowels</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Alternation</strong>: morphophonemic rules concern two (or more) forms of the same morpheme, which are referred to as alternants</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="morphology">Morphology</h2>

<p><strong>Morphology</strong>: study of the structure of words</p>

<p>Morpheme: a minimal unit of sound and meaning</p>

<h3 id="morphological-processes">Morphological Processes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Affixation (suffixes, prefixes, circumfixes, infixes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternations (break/broke, Semitic Languages)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduplication (total reduplication (Japanese ware / wareware) vs. partial reduplication)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compounding (making complex words out of a combination of stems, as opposed to stem and affix, e.g. German)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hierarchical structure of words: words that has an internal structure, e.g., “unlockable”</p>

<h4 id="languages-differ-in-terms-of-their">Languages differ in terms of their:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>phonological inventories: phoneme inventory + tones</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>morphology</strong>: <strong>inventories of elements</strong> (e.g. some have dual form, some only plural and singular, some only singular); what is expressed in a word</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="broad-phonetic-writing-stress-vs-narrow-phonetic-writing-allophones-eg-aspiration"><strong>broad phonetic writing</strong> (stress+!!) vs. <strong>narrow phonetic writing</strong> (allophones e.g. aspiration)</h4>

<p>contrastive/phonemic distribution: makes minimal pairs</p>

<p>noncontrastive/nonphonemic distribution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>complementary distribution → allophones</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>free variation</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="another-way-of-seeing-this-do-they-occur-in-the-same-environment">Another way of seeing this: Do they occur in the same environment?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Yes - <strong>overlapping distribution</strong> → do they have different meanings?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Yes - <strong>free variation</strong> (e.g. economics)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>No - <strong>contrastive distribution</strong> → <strong>minimal pairs</strong> (e.g. Hindi [p] and [ph])</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No - <strong>complementary distribution</strong> → <strong>allophones</strong>, and there is a <strong>phonological rule</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>mental dictionary →(allophonic rules)→ phonetic speech</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>phone</td>
      <td>allophone</td>
      <td>phoneme, as</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>morph</td>
      <td>allomorph</td>
      <td>morpheme</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>(<strong>phone</strong> is independent of language, and corresponds to IPA as it is only identified as its sound; <strong>phoneme</strong> is dependent on the language, as the smallest distinguishable sound that can create minimal pairs; allophone stresses the relationship between several phones, that they are in complementary distribution)</p>

<p>Free/Bound morph: can be a word on its own / prefix/infix/suffix/stem of a word</p>

<p><strong>Lexical (content) Morphemes</strong>: presence is directly determined by what we are talking about; express somewhat concrete meanings; relatively infrequent; open-set membership; always has a stressed syllable (in languages like English).</p>

<p><strong>Grammatical (function) Morphemes</strong>: presence obligated by the grammar of the language; express rather abstract meanings; very frequent; closed-set membership; typically lack stressed syllables.  </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Free Lexical: content nouns - person, book</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bound Lexical (derivational)</strong>: -ing (v. → n.) -ment, -ize [(1) change part of speech or the meaning; (2) nonproductivity; (3) suffixability]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Free Grammatical: personal pronouns (I, she), conjunction(and, so), preposition(to, of)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bound Grammatical (inflectional)</strong>: s(plural suffix &amp; third person singular) -ing, -ed, -er(comparative), -est(superlative), -n(some past participle suffix) [(1) no function change (2) productivity (3)nonsuffixability], including case morphology as well (e.g. Latin declensions)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="morphological-fusion">Morphological Fusion</h3>

<p>Multiple meanings that cannot be separated (e.g. men: man+plural)</p>

<p><strong>Translational Equivalents</strong> usually exists in lexical, not grammatical,  morphemes.</p>

<p>Langage varies from <strong>analytic</strong> (few if any bound morphemes, mostly free morphemes) to <strong>synthetic</strong> (bound morphemes attached to bound morphemes); word order becomes less important in synthetic languages.</p>

<p>Agglutenation languages glue morphemes together (without inflections) e.g. Swahili</p>

<p>Fusional languages: bound morphemes contain more than one meaning e.g. Spanish &amp; Latin verb conjugations</p>

<p>Polysynthetic languages: words contain several stems and affixes e.g. Siberian Yupik</p>

<p>Among the allomorphs, one is regular (productive, predictable based on phonological context), while the irregular (unproductive, not predictable) allomorphs have to be memorized by speakers</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>Constituents: a (group of) word(s) that function as a single unit within a hierarchical structure - Wikipedia</p>

<p>Function: relationship of the noun phrases to the verb and to other words and word groups in the sentences. </p>

<p>Word Order: temporal or linear sequence of words of the sentence.</p>

<p>Coordination conjunction: and &amp; or</p>

<p>Coordination: a sort of recursion: groups like sentence, NP, VP, PP may be expanded as a pair of such phrases.</p>

<p>Test for Constituents:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Replacement test: sentence → n. (/pronoun); NP → pronoun; VP → do; PP → adverb</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Movement test: my appear in different places in different versions of a sentence. e.g. It is the koalas that live in trees. OR, change active/passive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Answer to a question</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grouping Ambiguity: attests to our awareness of the different possibilities for grouping in syntactic structure</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Lexical ambiguity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Structural ambiguity (e.g. unlockable): when a phrase or sentence has two or more meanings because of structure</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Grouping ambiguity: The boy ate the cake in the closet</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Function ambiguity: Visiting professors can be boring. (visiting as an infinitive verb / adj.; professor as object/subject) ??? which change is decisive?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="phrase-structure-rules">Phrase Structure Rules:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>S → NP VP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>X → XP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>XP → (Spec) X Mn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NP → (Det) (AjP) N (PP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VP → V ({NP, S, AjP}) (PP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PP → P NP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AjP → (Deg) Aj</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>X → X C X // C - conjunction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(from Ch.18) VP → Aux V // Aux - auxiliary verb</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(from Ch.18) S → Comp S // Complementizer - “[that/if/because/so] it rained” (pp.297–298)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall: [[(Det) (AjP) N (PP)]NP [V ({NP, S, AjP})(PP)]VP]S</p>

<p>Grammatical/Ungrammatical: whether sentence is generated by rules or not.</p>

<h4 id="4-types-of-verb-complement">4 types of verb complement</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Take nouns as complements: see, eat, find, take, send</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take adjectives as complements: be, look, seem, feel, become</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take sentences as complements (sentential complement verbs): say, imagine, think, believe, promise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take no complements (intransitive verbs): fall, smile, sleep, laugh, walk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ditransitive verbs (give, send) take 3 arguments</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 id="child-language-acquisition">Child Language Acquisition</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Typical (children usually are able to acquire the language they are supposed to learn (that of their community))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar from child to child (stages of acquisition as below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spontaneous (instruction in the usual sense is unnecessary)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creative (ability to create new sentences that they have never heard before e.g. over-regularization, etc.)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="stages-of-language-acquisition">Stages of Language Acquisition</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>cooing: velar consonants ([k], [g]) and back vowels ([u]) [6–8 weeks]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>babbling: unrecognizable but word-like vocalization [~6 months]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>start to differentiate only the phonemes of their parents’ language: [8 months ~ one year]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>holophrastic stage / one-word stage: after producing the first word [~1 year] to gradually(?) two-word stage / telegraphic speech [**18 months]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first grammatical morpheme: **2 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>telegraphic speech: two-word sentences [18 months]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>basic mastery: ~4 years</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mistakes--features">Mistakes / features:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>phoneme substitution</strong>: fronting (consonants with more forward articulation replace those with less forward articulation); stopping (stops replace other manners of articulation); perseverance (preceding phone replaces other manners of articulation, e.g. [gagi] for “glasses”); anticipation: following phone replaces the preceding one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>morphological breakdown</strong> - Miami → my “ami”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Morphological rules: <strong>Overgeneralization</strong> (generalize productive rules to irregular ones) &amp; <strong>Overregularization</strong> (result of overgeneralization: using two allomorphs together): twice e.g. come’s past tense said as “camed”, mess’s past tense becomes “mested”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Overextension</strong> (all things similar to leaf (leaves, vegetables, all green things) as a leaf) &amp; <strong>underextension</strong> (calls a dog “dog” as if it is the dog’s name)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="explanations-of-child-language-learning">Explanations of Child language learning:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conditioned-response learning (i.e. classical conditioning - children are reinforced for their learning behavior) {sounds persuasive, but some phenomenons, e.g. double negatives, overextension, are “unstimulated”. Thus, comprehension must precede naturalistic production.}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imitation: attest to local vocabulary and accent, encouraged by parents as in “caregiver talk” {although, again, special features like over-generalizations cannot be imitated, and that children cannot give exact copy on esp. grammatical morphemes “nobody [don’t] likes me”}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hypothesis testing / trial and error learning: (i.e. operant conditioning) {where the hypotheses come from, why do the wrong form persist if “testing” proves them wrong}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innateness of language: physiological, both phonological and neurobiological; that language is more like walking than writing: although encouraged, it is more spontaneous than requiring necessary teaching (inherited predisposition to learn). {but, the physiological similarity may have arisen because of different functionalities like thinking and tool-using, not (solely) for language}</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h2 id="language-change">Language Change</h2>

<p>Historical linguistics: an approach to linguistics (not a component)</p>

<h3 id="why-do-languages-change">Why do languages change</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Imperfect language learning (e.g. disappearance of voiceless bilabial fricatives into voiced bilabial fricatives; restructuring)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social motivations for change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language contact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Natural articulary/perceptual processes</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-fast-do-languages-change">How fast do languages change</h3>

<p>Not constant with each other or throughout time; after ~1000 years, not usually mutually intelligible; after ~10000 years, linguists cannot tell relationship. </p>

<p>Components of Language Change: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change">semantic change</a>: word changes meaning (elevation, pejoration, lateral shift, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>syntactic change: negation (ne pas); word order (sov to svo in Yiddish)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>morphological change: morphological paradigms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>phonetic/phonological change: sound change (both diachronic and synchronic (dialects))</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Phonological change happens when one phoneme becomes completely lost, i.e. change in inventory</strong> (e.g. American dialects the combination of [a] and [ɔ]); while phonetic change is change in pronunciation of one phoneme. But if one phoneme becomes lost, the change is phonological. </p>

<p>Dialect areas are separated by a bundle of lines known as <strong>isoglosses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Relic area</strong>: area that has preserved older linguistic forms not found in the surrounding area</p>

<p><strong>Diachronic</strong> change (along history) vs. <strong>Synchronic</strong> (present-day)</p>

<h3 id="history-of-english">History of English</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Old English (–1100)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middle English (1100–1500)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modern English (1500–present)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Relic Forms</strong> of a word: a word generally lost from a language but survives in specialized uses (e.g. “let” as hinder, “plumb” as lead, “wer” as man in werewolf)</p>

<p><strong>Grimm’s Law</strong>: set of sound changes that affected voiced and voiceless stop consonants between Indo-European and Germanic languages. (Jacob Grimm) (e.g. p→f: pater→father; pes→foot)</p>

<p>Chain Shifts: change in one sound that triggers another sound to change in order to remain distinct (mostly vowels, but consonants are also possible - Grimm’s Law)</p>

<p>I. Great Vowel Shift in English:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>[i]→[əɪ]; [u]→[əu]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[e]→[i]; [o]→[u]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[a]→[æ]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ɔ]→[o]; [ɛ]→[e]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[æ]→[ɛ]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[e]→[i]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ɛ]→[e]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[əɪ]→[aɪ]; [əu]→[au]</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>II. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cities_Vowel_Shift">Nothern Vowel Shift</a></p>

<p><strong>Leveling</strong>: when one of the two forms of a meaning becomes extinct, it is said to be leveled</p>

<p><strong>Suppletive</strong>: fully irregular forms and are especially targets of leveling. </p>

<p>Comparative Reconstruction: ???????</p>

<p>Lingua Franca - “independently of the linguistic history or structure of the language”, not necessarily but contains Pidgins and Creoles. “any language used by speakers of diverse languages to communicate with each other”</p>

<p><strong>Word frequency effect</strong>: common words are processed faster than uncommon words.</p>

<p><strong>Recency effect</strong>: words that we see more recently are processed better.</p>

<p>Most knowledge comes from brains that have been injured (stroke, head trauma, degenerative disease - cause <strong>lesion</strong>; aphasia) (whereas nowadays the function shifts to wards computer techniques - do not need to wait for the patient to die)</p>

<p>Independence of language and cognition(intelligence): <strong>Savant’s syndrome</strong> (normal language ability but problematic cognition); <strong>Williams syndrome</strong> (genetic linguistic impairment); - both are cognition impairments without linguistic fluency. But, Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: language determines/influence thoughts and cognition. </p>

<p>Human brain is around 3 pounds, has ~100 billions of nerve cells</p>

<p>The brain is divided into two (roughly symmetrical) <strong>hemispheres</strong>, divided by a deep groove and connected by <strong>corpus callosum</strong>, a band of nerve fibres.</p>

<p><strong>Contralateralization</strong>: left hemisphere controlling the right part of the body. </p>

<p><strong>Lateralization</strong>: certain tasks are performed/processed primarily by/in one hemisphere as opposed to the other (takes place early in life but not from birth)</p>

<p>Left hemisphere is associated with speech -</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>motor activity is related to speech</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>language is originally gestural/manual rather than oral</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Aphasia: (affected speech caused by brain injury)(language impairment without other cognitive impairment - see also <strong>Specific Language Impairment</strong>, SLI)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Broca’s aphasia</strong> (dominant (usually left) hemisphere, lower rear portion of <strong>frontal lobe</strong>) [comprehension(+), grammatical morpheme(-), <strong>agrammatism</strong>, interpretable speech but not fluent] (<strong>non-fluent aphasia</strong>) (<strong>telegraphic speech</strong> - absence of function words/morphemes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wernicke’s aphasia</strong> (dominant hemisphere, <strong>temporal&amp;parietal lobes</strong>) [comprehension(-), lexical morphemes / <strong>content words</strong> (-) esp. nouns, fluent speech but no coherence, senseless and unaware of it] (<strong>fluent aphasia</strong>) (<strong>neologisms</strong> - meaninglessly created new words) (severe Wernicke’s aphasia may be called <strong>jargon aphasia</strong>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transcortical sensory aphasia</strong>: well-preserved repetition, but no comprehension or propositional speech</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anomic aphasia</strong>: (damage in temporal, parietal area) inability to name things; word-finding problems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Agrammatic aphasia</strong>: recognizes lexical stimulus, but no grammatical stimulus (see Fromkin, p.50)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does Hamlet have Wernicke’s aphasia? Yes - odd expressions; makes little sense; No - no neologism; grammatical speech

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Lexical ambiguity</strong> (resulted from homonyms (homophones - same sound / homographs - same spelling); homonyms are similar but not equal to polysemy (semantic extension into several meanings, a single pronunciation is associated with more than two meanings that are distinct but related) also, there is <strong>antonymy</strong>, where two words are opposite in meaning [e.g. alive/dead (<strong>complementary pairs</strong>, a = not b); big/small (<strong>gradable pairs</strong>: one is marked [e.g. how big is this → “big” is marked] and one is not marked); give/receive(<strong>relational opposites</strong>: display symmetry in meaning)])</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“They read books.” Lexical, NOT <del>functional</del>, because past tense is part of lexicon. Neither part of speech, nor subject/object relationship, changes.</p>

<p>Lexical morpheme is content words, as opposed to grammatical morpheme (function words).</p>

<p>Content words can be concrete (book, table, computer) or abstract (exam, linguistics, concept, happiness).</p>

<p>Content vs. abstract, just as lexical vs. grammatical, is not necessarily free morphemes. They could be bound morphemes as well.</p>
