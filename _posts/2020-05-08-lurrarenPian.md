I am trying to learn the piece _Lurraren Pian_, which I first heard in an album by Maria Bayo. For some reason I thought it was in Occitan for a long time, but after I finally printed the music and examined it further, I realized that it is in Basque (well, that was at least geographically close).

With some search on Google and library sites, I was not able to find any good source of IPA. There is the Wikipedia page about Basque phonology. There is a guide in French about how to pronounce Basque at the beginning of a Basque songbook. Lastly, there is a paper about how to prevent tomatoes from wilting, or so it seems. Above all else, I found most sources about Basque to be in French.

So, I decided to annotate the IPA and perhaps the translation as well from the text, the Basque phonology and pronunciation guide, and Maria Bayo's recording.

The text that I use is taken from the Basque Songbook, from the site Eusko Ikaskuntza.

## IPA

**Lurraren pian sar nindaiteke, maitia, zure ahalgez!** [^1]

[lu.ra.ɾen pʲen s̺ar nin.dai.te.ke mai.ti.a, su.ɾe ahaʎes]

**Bost phensaketa eginik nago zurekin ezkondu beharrez;**

[bost pʰen.s̺a.ke.ta e.gi.nik na.go su.ɾe.kin es.kon.du be.ha.res]

**Bortha barnetik zerratu eta bethi khanberan nigarrez,**

[boɾ.tʰa baɾ.ne.tik se.ra.tu e.ta be.tʰi kʰan.be.ɾan ni.ga.res]

**Sendimenduiak airian eta bihotzetikan dolorez...**

[s̺en.di.men.du.jak ai.ɾi.a.ne.ta bi.ho.tse.ti.kan do.lo.ɾes]

**Ene changrinez [^2] hilerazteko sothuia zinez [^3] arauez!**

[e.ne tʃan.gɾi.nes hi.le.ɾas.te.ko so.tʰu.ja si.nes a.ɾa.wes]

[^1]: For the word _ahalgez_, I cannot find any reliable rule that says _-lg-_ is pronounced as [ʎ], but it seems to be [ʎ] in the recording.
[^2]: The word _chagrinez_ is probably spelled irregularly because it is a loanword from French _chagrin_ ("pain, affliction").
[^3]: The Cantelope score (as well as Bayo's recording) spelled this word as _zinen_.
<br>

**Oren hunian sorthuia zinen izar ororen izarra!**

[o.ɾen hu.ni.an s̺oɾ.tʰu.ja si.nen i.saɾ o.ɾo.ɾen i.sa.ra]

**Zure parerik etzaut jiten neure begien bistara.**

[su.ɾe pa.ɾe.ɾik e.tsa.ut [^4] xi.ten ne.u.ɾe be.gi.en bis̺.ta.ɾa]

**Espos laguntzat gald'egin zintudan erran nerauzun bezala:**

[es̺.pos̺ la.gun.tsat gal.de.gin sin.tu.dan e.ran ne.ɾau.sun be.sa.la]

**Bainan zuri ez iduritu zuretzat aski nintzala;**

[ba.i.nan su.ɾi es i.du.ɾi.tu su.ɾe.tsat as̺.ki nin.tsa.la]

**Ni baino hobebatekila Jainkoak gertha zitzala!**

<br>

**Mariñelak juaiten dira itsasorat untziko:**

[ma.ɾi.ɲe.lak xu.ai.ten di.ɾa i.ts̺a.s̺o.ɾat un.tsi.ko]

**Zure ganako amodioa sekulan ezdut utziko.**

[su.ɾe ga.na.ko a.mo.di.o.a s̺e.ku.lan es.dut u.tsi.ko]

**Charmagarria, nahiz ez giren elgarrekilan biziko,**

[tʃaɾ.ma.ga.ri.a na.his es gi.ɾen el.ga.re.ki.lan bi.si.ko]

**Behin maite izan zaitut eta etzaitut hastiatuko:**

[be.hin mai.te i.san sai.tut e.ta e.tsai.tut has.ti.a.tu.ko]

**Bihotzian sarthu zitzautat eternitate guziko.**

[bi.ho.tsi.an s̺aɾ.tʰu si.tsau.tat e.teɾ.ni.ta.te gu.si.ko]

[^4]: Bayo pronounced this word as [e.tʃa.ut], but according to pronunciation rules I cannot find out why.


#### Pronunciation guide/notes:
- Wikipedia notated the diphthongs with no lax vowels. I followed their notation here.
- Basque has a contrast between these two voiceless fricatives: the laminal alveolar fricative (written as _-z-_ in the orthography) and the voiceless apicoalveolar fricative (written as _-s-_). I will respectively notated each sound as [s] and [s̺].
- [h] can be a glottal fricative or, in some dialects, deleted. In Bayo's recording, it was used somewhat interchangeably.

## Translation

Please enjoy a Basque-to-English translation by Google translate:

>I can enter the earth, my dear, with your might!<br>
I have made five thoughts of having to marry you;<br>
Bortha sawed from the inside and always wept in the khanberan,<br>
Feelings of pain in the air and in the heart ...<br>
The rules of burying my changrine are truly rules!<br><br>
At this hour you were born the star of every star!<br>
Your peer does not appear in my sight.<br>
I asked you for help, as I told you:<br>
But don't think that I was enough for you;<br>
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.<br><br>
The sailors go to sea:<br>
I will never give up my love for you.<br>
Charming, even if we don't live together,<br>
I have loved you once and will not hate you:<br>
You have entered my heart for all eternity.<br><br>
First of all, the beautiful bird khantuz phaguan!<br>
Love yourselves, my love, in your goodness;<br>
I don't want to rape you in love:<br>
If I die of this Changri, remember that,<br>
I'll be alone in the world! <br>

... Seems like there are words that Google translate doesn't know very well.
