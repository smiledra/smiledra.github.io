This is a project from my CLA101 (Introduction to Antiquity) class, in which we read text from/about the ancient Greece and Rome. In the project we are supposed to make timelines about major events of Greek/Rome. I was at a conference (Interspeech 2019) during the first project about ancient Greek, and got a grade low enough to motivate me to put more efforts in the second project. The final deliverable can be embedded in the form of `html`, so I thought it would be fun to put it here.
