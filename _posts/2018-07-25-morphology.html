<p>Noun class systems can be powerful inflectional and derivational mechanisms. (p.63 cf. Kujamaat Jóola)</p>

<p>[…] Morphemes that lose their semantic content or morphosyntactic function as a result of language change.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>exaptation</strong>: when the morpheme is reanalyzed by the speaker to have a new meaning/role
<ul>
<li>psycholinguistically core for speakers to master complex linguistic systems</li>
<li>paleo → palesco: the inchoative aspect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>leveling</strong>: sounds that do not signify important difference in meaning are often eliminated
<ul>
<li>the tendency for languages to prefere regular paradigms over irregular ones leads to leveling</li>
<li>e.g. <strong>rhotacism</strong>:<br>
colos → coloses (Old Latin: Genitive) → coloris<br>
⇒ colos → color (cf. honor)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>analogy</strong>: A is to B as C is to D
<ul>
<li>the pattern that underlies the analogy process is often a productive rule</li>

<dt>Motivation</dt>
<dd>A sign is motivated if, by inspecting the sign, one can get clues as to what it means (cf. Saussurean Sign).</dd>
<dt>Compositionality</dt>
<dd>something is logically compositional if it is defined entirely in terms of its parts;<br>
(similar to motivation, but a term from logic).</dd>
<dt>nouce form/hapax legomenon</dt>
<dd>word (phrase) made up temporarily to refer to a particular reference, but not permanently stored in the lexicon.</dd>
<dt>endocentric/exocentric compounds</dt>
<dd>endocentric compounds have a head (e.g. <em>fish</em> in <em>goldfish</em>), whereas exocentric compounds’ meaning cannot be inferred from the head (e.g. <em>lazybones</em>, when the meaning is metaphoric)</dd>
<dt>zero-derivation</dt>
<dd>when a word is derivationally changed its part of speech, but there is no modification on the word itself<br>
e.g. <em>Will you chocolate my milk?</em><br>
zero-derived verbs often have a wide range of meanings, potentially spanning over {location, duration, agent, goal, instrument} (Ch.5)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Expomence: realization of morphosyntactic features via inflection
<ul>
<li>e.g., in “sailed”, /d/ is the <em>exponent</em> of the past participle</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>simple exponence: one exponent maps onto one morphosyntactic feature (see example above)</li>
<li>cumulative exponence: multiple features are reflected in one exponent (e.g. /o/ in cantō, I sing; also see many Indo-European verbs)</li>
<li>extended exponence: a single morphological feature is realized simultaneously on more than one form</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Inherence
<ul>
<li><strong>inherent inflection</strong>: if a word can only be used in certain morphosyntactic feature (e.g. <em>poeta</em> always feminine, <em>scissors</em> always plural</li>
<li>otherwise, inflection is <strong>assigned</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concord and Government
<ul>
<li><strong>concord</strong>: one element in a sentence takes on the morphosyntactic features of another element. e.g., n.-adj. agreement or inflection of person in Latin verbs (subject-verb agreement)</li>
<li><strong>agreement</strong>: = concord</li>
<li><strong>government</strong>: government (e.g. <em>frui</em> takes Abl., but since verbs do not have case, the Abl. object does not “agree” with the verb, but is governed by it. cf. propositions, such as “<em>ab</em> +Abl.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inflectional categories
<ul>
<li>person - inclusive (e.g. <em>咱们</em>) or exclusive (e.g. <em>我们</em> when used as opposed to <em>咱们</em>)</li>
<li>tense - <strong>imperfective</strong> and <strong>perfective</strong>: denoting action in progress or completed action</li>
</ul>
</li>

<dl>
<dt>apophony (internal change)</dt>
<dd>vowel changes within a root (e.g. foot → feet)</dd>
<dt>umlaut</dt>
<dd>specifically refers to the assimilation of the vowel with the following vowel in the singular-plural case.<br>
cf. goose-geese, the word-final vowel has since-then disappeared, but the assimilation remained as a plural marker.</dd>
<dt>suppletion</dt>
<dd>when morphological changes are not predictable and totally different;<br>
e.g. am/are/is/were inflection system.<br>
a.k.a. “irregular”?</dd>
<dt>syncretism</dt>
<dd>a single inflected form corresponds to more than one set of morphosyntactic features.<br>
e.g., English “you” both Nom. and Acc.<br>

<p>Classification of language based on the comparative study of types</p>

<center>analytic ⇒ synthetic

<li>isolating (Vietnamese, no derivational or inflectional morphology)</li>
<li>inflective (subtype of which, agglutinating <em>cf. Turkish</em>)</li>
<li>fusional (Latin)</li>
<li>polysynthetic (North American languages, e.g. Nootka</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ch.-7-morphology--syntax">Ch. 7 Morphology &amp; Syntax</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese lexemes have only one form, abstracting away from phonologically determined alternations (mostly changes in tone <em>(???)</em>). While Chinese has a few clitics or particles, including one that expresses past tense, these are generally not considered to be affixes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from this Chinese example, and cf. Russian → “morphological inflection is realized overtly, where syntactic inflection may or may not be.”</p>

</table><h2 id="ch.-8-morphological-productivity">Ch. 8 Morphological Productivity</h2>
<p>“a morphological pattern is productive” ⇌ there is a higher probability of a potential word in this pattern to be accepted in this language, compared with some other pattern(s)</p>
<p>Some Chomskian terms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>competence</dt>
<dd>knowledge of a language, possessed by its speaker/hearer</dd>
<dt>performance</dt>
<dd>how the language is actually used in concrete situations</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then, it is necessary to demonstrate that productivity is constrained</p>
<ol>
<li>phonologically</li>
<li>morphologically</li>
<li>syntactically (e.g. re- can only be attached to verbs, not nouns)</li>
<li>semantically (some concepts are simply uncommon/unlikely)</li>
<li><strong>blocking</strong>: if one form already exists for a certain derivation/inflection of a word, use of the new, productive form will be blocked by this existant form.
<ul>
<li>e.g. child → children, not childs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, unproductive (since they are constrained) forms can be more <strong>salient</strong> in the context. Therefore, sometimes unproductive forms are used for emphasis, or for new words (e.g. coining technical terms).</p>
<p>Cognitively: (Jaeger et al., 1996)<br>
PET scan shows that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subjects spoke aloud the past tense forms of regular verbs significantly faster than irregular verbs;<br>
When subjects were asked to give the past tense of irregular verb forms, their brains showed larger areas of brain activity;<br>
Tasks involving regular/irregular verbs activate different areas of subjects’ brains.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>What is the place of gender and duals (number)? Are they vestigial forms in language that emerged earlier due to certain historical reason, but later deprecated? Why are these forms hardly, or ever, re-evolved later in any languages? Is the cost too high? If the cost was once low enough that such rules were created, then what has changed?</p>
