## Text replacement

MacOS has an easy way to set up text replacement. This is useful for occasional math-related notations and typos. While Windows must have a way to make this work too, I find it much easier to search for such things with a linux tag. [Espanso](https://espanso.org/install/) ended up working well. One `config.yml` covers most things I can think of. I also tried AutoKey for a while, but there is an unresolved bug that seem to remain as an unresolved issue on the original repo (which doesn't seem to be maintained much anymore).

## Input method (updated 3/18/2021)

This was a major pain back when I was using MacOS. I wrote a separate rant about the installation process of this elsewhere (I might put it on my website as well because the other platform supports markdown rather poorly), so here I will try to be concise.

My particular need on input methods is that I need to be able to switch between a couple languages at the same time, and the "switch to the next input method" keybinding always requires me to press it once, see if it has changed to the desired input method, and if not, keep repeating this process until it does. This process annoys me for some unknown reason, and all I want is a method to switch to a particular input method without needing to look and check. [Rime](https://rime.im/download/#linux) has been awesome in supporting different types of Chinese (Simplfied AND Traditional), as well as other orthographies such as Japanese, Korean and IPA. I did not go for this when I switched to Rime, but turns out it's also useful in typing symbols such as ℃ and § (if you ever need to). It's also practically programmable, thus allowing me to waste hours of time on the config file.
