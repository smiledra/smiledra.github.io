## Lecture 3

Today, we will discuss the introduction chapter, which includes useful concepts such as using models for prediction 
vs. inference, and terms such as parametric and nonparametric models. We will also introduce linear regression,
which we will look into in more detail in the assigned readings and the discussion tomorrow. 

Agenda:
- Go over the Ch.2 readings assigned
- Watch Andrew Ng's lecture:
	1. Model representation (8 min)
	2. Cost function (8 min)

### Assignments:
1. Read ISLR Ch. 3, up to the end of 3.1 (pp. 59-71)
2. Comment the codes on the jupyter notebook (I forgot to send the notebook since last time...)
3. Give a proof of Equation _2.3_. Section _2.2.2_ may be relevant to this equation, but is a bit out-of-context now. 
It may be beneficial to read it later.
