## Determinant

Think of the determinant as giving the area of a 2D matrix, or the volume of a 3D matrix, etc., after the particular
transformation of the space specified by the space. The area of anything in the 2D/3D space after the transformation 
can be approximated by small squares composed of $$\hat{i}$$ and $$\hat{j}$$. 

## Matrix Multiplication

$$AB = C$$

 For two matrices, $$A$$ and $$B$$, if $$A$$ is of size $$n \times m$$ and $$B$$ is of size
 $$m \times p$$, then $$A \times B$$ is valid and will yield a new matrix of size $$n \times p$$. [^1]
 
 
### Relation to dot product

For two column vectors, the dot product of these vectors is the matrix product $$ x^{T}\cdot y $$. 

## Vectors

By default, column vectors are used for this discussion.

### Dot product

The [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) of two vectors yields a scalar. The analogy of this is one 
vector's projection times the other vector:

$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \left \| \vec{a} \right \|\left \| \vec{b} \right \| \cos{\theta }$$

### Cross product

The [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product) of two vectors yields a vector. It is only defined in 
3D space and the formula is given below: 

$$\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \left \| \vec{a} \right \| \left \| \vec{b} \right \| \sin{ \theta }  \vec{n}$$

Note that $$\vec{n}$$ is a unit vector that is perpendicular to both $$\vec{a}$$ and $$\vec{b}$$, in the direction that
is given by the right hand rule.
