## Notetaking

This endeavor includes notes on random things that I read/browse. Below is the log:

☛ [11.1.2017 - MUR221 (Music History I) Notes for the second midterm](20191027_MUR221_MidtermII.html) Review sheet, including terms and names, for a midterm exam.<br>
☛ [07.25.2018 - Aronoff & Fudeman, 2005](20180725_morphology.html) Book: _What is morphology?_ <br>
☛ [08.14.2019 - Notes on LIN110 (Intro to Linguistics)](20190814_LIN110.html) I took LIN110 in fall 2016, with Prof. Abtahian. These notes are made for the open-book final, so they turned out to be very search-friendly and I have been used as a reference guide since. <br>
☛ [11.3.2019 - Timeline of Ancient Rome](20191103_CLA101_timelineRome.html) Review sheet, including terms and names, for a midterm exam.<br>
