title: "Some Seneca translation and others"
tags: [Classics, notes]
finished: true
---
This is a pasting bin of some translation materials from Latin, which I made to prepare for a final exam in LAT391, an independent study on Seneca. 

I was once good at Latin... And I should read more Seneca. 

Note that `???` or question marks of arbitrary number means I'm either not sure how to translate the Latin there, or not sure if the English is good enough to be passable as good English. Translating from my third language to my second is not easy, especially now, looking back, my first language might be the least fluent of all. The major goal of me studying Latin is to understand chants and Seneca (although Latin helped with my GRE vocabulary, I think, it was not intended), and for that matter, I do not put much effort in editing the English translation but rather focus on understanding the Latin (especially the grammar). They are such nice mental exercise to me, and especially when studying Latin of different time, I got so much brain candy from the beautiful phonetic and syntactic changes. It's historical linguistics for free. That's probably also why I'm immersed in studying ancient Japanese now. Aside from it being beautiful.

## De Clementia

### 1.1: A mirror for the prince

I decided to write about clemency, Caesar Nero, so that, in a way, I would perform (serve) [speculi vice???] the purpose of a mirror, and I would show to you that you are about to go through towards the greatest pleasure of all. For however much the true fruit of deeds is to have been rightfully done, nor any of the virtue of price??? is worthy to that out of themselves, it helps to inspect and to surround the good conscience, thus to send the eyes into this huge multitude, discordant, troublesome, and powerless, about to let go to the destruction of themselves and others equally , if it should break this yoke, and thus to say with oneself: ...

### 1.2: The emperor recognizes his power

"Have I pleased, out of all mortals, and have been selected for the purpose of serve in the lands of gods, as a vicar? [vice???] I am the arbiter fo life and death to nations. What each man's lot and state shall be, is placed in my hand (???); what and to whom Fortune wishes to be given, she announces through my mouth. Out of my response, people and cities receive reasons for rejoicing. No part of the wide world can prosper unless with me willing and well-disposed (favorable). All those many thousands of swords, which my peace restrains (lit. presses together), are drawn tight toward my command. Which nations to destroy all the way to its foundation, which to be banished, to which freedom to be given, to which freedom to be snatched away, which kings to become slaves and the head of what king should decorations be put around, which cities should fall to ruin, which shall rise, it is my right to say."

### 1.3–4: Young Nero's boast

"In this control of matter so great of things, anger did not compel me toward unjust punishments, nor did juvenile impulses, or the rashness or man and arrogance, which often twist the patience in even the most tranquil heart, not the dire glory itself for the purpose of showing power through terror, but often found in great empires. On the contrary, the sword is hidden constricted in my reign (or, within me), with the greatest parsimony even to the cheapest (most worthless) blood; no one, to whom other things are lacking, with the name of a man is not full of thanks in my reign. I have strctness concealed, but mercy at ready (in vicinity); such I guard myself, as if I am about to render the account to the laws, which I evoke out of the sight and darkness into the light. I am moved by the youth of one, old age of another; I gave one (mercy) for his dignity, another for his humility; as many times I had found no cause for mercy, and I spared myself. Today the immortal gods, if from me they seek back a reckoning, I am prepared to count the human race."

### 1.5–6: You are your own best model

Caesar, you are able to boldly proclaim: all, which came into your trust and protection, are rendered safe (lit. had), that nothing through you, neither by force or secretly, is taken away from the republic. You have desired the most rare praise, given to no one up to this point – innocence of wrong. You do not give up the effort (i.e. your effort is not in vain), nor has the sigualr benevolence of yours obtain the ungrateful or malign judges. Gratitude is carried back to you; not one person so dear to one person ever existed, than you to the people of Rome; (you are) the great and long goodness of them. But you have imposed great burden to yourself; no one now speaks of the godly Augustus or the early years of Tiberius Caesar, nor seeks an exemple which he wishes you to imitate other than yourself; your rule is examined to suit the taste (???). This would have been difficult, if such kindness were not natural to you, but taken up by (through) time. For no one is able to carry a mask for long, and with the feigned (gesture) provoked, they return to their nature. To that thing which truth underlies, and that thing, so to say, born/arisen out of the solid earth, in that very time they proceed/advance into the greater and better. 

### 9.1–3: Augustus and the conspirator

This which is true, I wish to admonish you with a domestic exemple. The godly Augustus was a mild leader, if anyone starts to estimate that one (i.e. him) from the time of his principate; indeed, he wielded sword in the shared republic. When he was in this age, which you now are, having just passed his 18th year, and now he had already hidden daggers in the belly of his friends, already sought side of of the consul Mark Antony, and already been a colleague (co-conspirator) of the proscription. But when he passed the age of 40, and was spending time in Gallia, information was carried down to him that Lucius Cinna, a man of dull nature, was constructing plots against him; It was said regarding when, where and in what way he wished to assail; one out of his conspirators was carrying down the news. He decided to avenge himself upon the fellow, and ordered a council of his friends to be called. The night was restless to him, when he was thinking about the noble young man, blameless but for this act, the grandson of Gnaeus Pompeius, who was to be condemned...

### 9.4–6: The emperor's exasperation and Livia's remedy

Groaning repeatedly, he was speaking out various words and disagreeing with each other: "So what? I will suffer, and allow my assassin to walk around safe, even though I am the one anxious?" Once again, with silence interposed, he was becoming angry wiht a much greater voice to himself than to Cinnae: "Why do you live, if it is the interest of so many people that you die? What will be the end of this punishment (price)? What blood (should be the last)? I am the head exposed to teh noble young man, against which daggers are sharpened. It is not (worth) the life of so many people, if, so that I would not die, so much (life) must be destroyed." Finally, Livi the wife interrupted him and said: "Would you accept a womanly plan? Do the thing, which physicians are accustomed to , which, when they cannot proceed with common remedy, they try the contrary. Up to now, you have not accomplished anything by severity... Now try, how clemency would yield to you; forgive L. Cinna. He is arrested (captured); he is not able to harm you any more, but he is able to benefit your fame."

### 9.7–10: Interview with the would-be assassin

 Happy, because he had found an advocate to himself, he gave thanks to his wife indeed, and he ordered his friends to be cancelled immediately, whom he had invited into the council; he ordered Cinna alone to be fetched to him, and with everyone else having been dismissed from the private room, when he ordered another chair to be placed to Cinna, and said: "This first I ask from you, so that you do not interrupt me speaking, or cry out in the middle of my discourse. free time will be given to you to speak. I to you, Cinna, when I found us in the camps of enemies, not only as a made enemy to me, but born as one, I have saved you (nonetheless), and I left all your inheritance to you. While such I am worthy of you, you have planned to kill me." When (Cinna) exclaimed, in response to this words that he is far from such a madness (ab se??), "You do not show loyalty to me, Cinna," he said, "It had been agreed that you do not interrupt me. Killing, I was saying, of me that you prepare." He then threw the place, the conspirators, the date, the order of the plot, and to who the sword is set against. And when when he saw Cinna, fixed, not because of agreement, but out of his conscience, was silent, he said: "With what intention do you do this? So that you yourself would be the emperor? Evils, by Hercules, is being stirred with the Roman people, if nothing beyonds me prevents you from being in command. You are not able to protect your home, recently you were defeated by the thanks of a freed man in private trial..."

### 9.11–12 I forgive you

I shall not take up great part of the volume by repeating the entire speech of him (for it is agreed/said that the speaking was longer than two hours)., "Life", he said, "I give once again to you, the first time you were an (open) enemy, now the plot-maker and a parricide. Out of today, friendship starts between us. Let us contend, whether I am with better faith to you, since I have given you life, or you should be (of a better faith) to me." After this he bestowed upon him the council-ship, complaining because he did not dare to pursue. Cinna became the most dear (friendly) and faithful (to him), and was the only heir to him. No more was he sought by any plots by anyone. 

### 10.1–3: Augustus lives on

Your great-great grandfather forgave the conquered one; for if he had not forgiven, whom would he have ruled? This mercy guided him towards the safety and security; this restored him grateful and favorable???, however much he put his hand on the Roman people's necks, not yet subjugated; he shows here and today that fame, which hardly serves the living ruler???. We believe him to be god not as if we are ordered to; that emperor Augustus is good, that we confess the name of his parents was well-fitting to him... 

### Apocolocyntosis 10.1–3: The deified Augustus ashamed of his successors

Thus the godly Augustus rose at the place for his feelings that have to be said, and with greatest eloquence he explained: "I," he said, "I have you as my witness, conscript fathers, from this time I have been made god, I have made no words – I always lead my (own) business. And I cannot conceal any more, and to contain my gref, whom shame makes heavier. In this land and sea he created peace? For that reason he had checked civil wars? For this reason I have established the city with laws, decorated it with ornamentation, so that – what shall I say, p.c., I cannot find (words). All words are insufficient for my indignation. Therefore he must flee to Messala Coruinus, the most eloquent man, that sentiment Acc.??? 'it shames the empire.' Here, p.c., he who seems to be unable to you, so easilly he used to kill men, as easy as a dog sits down... Tell me, godly Claudius, what and whoever out of this, who and who (f) you have killed, before you learn the cause, before you hear, you have condemned? Here where??? are you accustomed to become? He shall not be in heaven..."

### De Ira 1.2.1–3: The costs of anger

Now truely, if you wish to protect the effects of anger, as well as the harms, no pest stands more to the human race. You will see slaughters and venoms and mutual filths of criminals, slaughter of cities and destruction fo then entire race and the head of leaders under the civil spear on hrie, and torches low-lying to the roof, nor fire (lit. fires) confined inside/within the city walls, but the hostile flames shining back the huge space of regions. Look at the foundations of the most noble cities, hardly remarkable, these anger overthrows. Look at the solitude, deserted through many miles without dweller: these anger drew out. Look at such leaders brought forth to memory, examples of ill fate: some are pierced by anger in his own bed, another is stroke within the sacred right of the table , another is teared to pieces within the laws and the spectacule of the celebrated court, another ordered to give blood by parricide of son, another ordered to open the regal yoke by hand of a slave, another to divide his limbs on a cross. And up to now I speak of the singular punishments: what if it pleases you to look at, leaving behind those which anger kindles/stirs man by man, cutting down a group of people by sword, and the plebs slaughtered, all epople condemned to death...? 

## Medea

### 1–18: Calling all gods

M: The marital gods and you, Lucina, the guardian of the nuptial bed,

and you (Minerva) who taught Tiphys to check the novel ship that whould tame the seas,

and you (Neptune), the severe dominator of the profound sea, 

and Titan, dividing the clear day to the earth (world)

bringing the knowing brightness to the silent rituals!

Hecate of three forms, the gods whom Jason sweared to me, whom it is more than just for Medea to pray to: 

chaos of the eternal night, realms turned away opposing above, 

and the impious ghosts of the dead,

 the master of the miserable kingdom, and the mistress snatched with better faith, 

I pray not with an auspicious voice.

now, now be present, the goddess of  the vengeful crime, squalid with respect to the hair, 

with the loosened serpents, embracing the dark torch with cruel hands, 

be present, once you [quales???] stood to my wedding chamber, horrifying: 

give death to the new marriage and death to the father-in-law and the stock of the palace 

### 40–50: I'm not a girl anymore

Through the very vitals, seek a road for punishment. 

If you live, courage, if any of the ancient vigor (strength) remains to you; 

expel (dismiss) the feminine fears and ??? in the uncivilized Caucasus in your mind. 

whatever sin Phasis or Pontus sees, Isthmos will see. 

The wild, unknown and fearful evil that must be feared by the sky and earth equally, the mind stirs on the inside:

wounds and calamity and death, (funus???) wandering through my limbs – I have talked about things too light:

these I did as a virgin; a heavior grief should rise: now greater evils is fitting to me after giving birth.

### 155–76: Rejecting sensible advice

M. The grief is light, which is able to conceive a plan, and then conceal itself: great evils do not hide. 

It is pleasing to go against it (attack head-on). N. Stop the frenzied impetum (violent attack), 

child: hardly the silent quietness defends you.

M. Fortune fears the strong ones, and presses the cowardly.

N. Therefore it must be approved, if courage is in place.

M. Never is courage out of place (lit. never is the place unable to be to courage).

N. No hope shows way to the afflicted matters. 

M. He who is unable to hope, nothing makes him despair. 

N. Colchis went away; nothing of a spouse is trust (is faithful).

and nothing survives out of such powers/wealth to you. 

M. Medea survives: here in sea and lands you see

the sword, the fire (lit. fires) and gods and thunders. 

N. The king must be feared. M. My father was once a king. 

N. You do not fear the arms? M. It is pleasing if they sprout (lit. emit) from earth. 

N. You shall die. M. I wish. N. Take refuge! M. It is shameful of flight (i.e. Flight is shameful).

N. Medea – Med. I shall become Medea. N. You are a mother.

M. You see who made me one (lit. See he to whom I am).

N. Do you hesitate to flee? M. I shall escape, but first I must avenge. 

N. Avengers will follow (you). M. Perhaps I will find delays.

N. Check your words, and now pardon, now, demented one, the threats, and reduce your courage: 

It is right to adapt to the time. 

M. Fortune can take away my riches (wealth), not my soul. 

301–8: Blame the boat

Chorus: Too bold is the man who first, with such fragile ship, broke into the faithless seas

and seeing his own land behind

he trusted his soul to the light air,

cutting the surface of sea with an unknown course

he was able to have confidence in the thin wood, 

between the change of life and death

with too slender a path having been led

### 361–79: The Argo's price

What is the prize of this journey? The golden fleece, and Medea, an evil greater than the sea. a pay/price worthy of the first vessel.

Now already the sea has yielded abides/endures all laws. 

Argo is not sought, carrying back the regal oars, made by hand by the famous Pallas.

The Indian drinks the cold Araxes, Persians the Albis and the Rhine. 

### 537–50: Finding Jason's weak spot

My courage is able to, as you know, and is used to contempt the regal wealth. 

I. I confess that I want to obey your implication/appeal; piety denies: and for that which I am able to suffer, not even the king and the father-in-law could force me myself. This is reason of my life, this is the solace to the cares of my heart, which has been burned through. 

I shall be able to sooner (i.e. I would rather be willing to) deprive my breath and limbs of light. 

M. Such he loves his sons? It is good. He is caught. The place to wound him lies open. 

### 670–93: She's planning something evil

My mind is frightened, and shudders: great disaster/devastation is present. 

How monstrous her resentment grows, and the very grief kindles itself and renews the past force. 

aggressam deos: assailing the gods

latebris desertis: with their hiding place deserted.

I must seek my venom from the heaven. Now it is time to move something more lofty than the common treachery. 

### 849–69: Her rage is visible

What deed is she preparing in wild furor?

She, arrogant, her head so often with wild motion, threatens beyond the king.

Her red cheeks flourishes, and then pallor put the redness into flight. 

vagante forma: her appearance changing

as a tiger bereft of children, roams in a furious path the Gange's groves.

Medea does not know to restrain from her anger, or love; now the anger and love joined their cause: what should follow? 

### 904–15: You ain't seen nothin' yet

Whatever has been committed so far, let it be called piety/love. I shall lead and make them know how light/trivial the vice will have been and of what common mark/stamp is the vice that I have committed/given. My grief rehearsed through that evil deed. What great thing could my untrained hand dare, and what girly furor? Now I am Medea: my natural skill/talent grows by means of evils: It delights me, it delights, to have snatched the head of my brother, and it pleases me to have cut the limbs and to have deprived the hidden holy object from my father, and it delights me to have armed the daughters of the old man towards destruction. Seek material, grief: To all the deeds, you will bring a (right) hand no longer untrained.

926–36: A brief return of maternal affection

Shivering beat my heart, my limbs grow numb with cold/frost and my heart trembled. 

Anger left from the place and the mother, with the wife utterly banished, returns. 

Am I to shed blood of my children and my offspring? Do a better thing, ah, demented furor! 

leave such a deed unknown and dire, a sin, away from me as well; What evil will the wretched (boys) pay? 

The crime is Jason, the father, and a greater crime is (to have) Medea the mother – 

Let they perish; (since) they are not mine. Let they die, (since) they are mine. 

They are lacking in crime and fault, I confess, they are innocent: and my brother also used to be innocent. 

### 1008–13: Double infanticide

I: One punishment is enough. 

M. If the hand is able to be satisfied by one calamity, it would have sought none. 

So that I shall kill two, even though the number is too small with respect to my grief. 

If ever the collateral lies in the mother even now, 

I will scrutinize the vitals with sword and drag them out with the iron. 

### 1018–27: Kill me instead

I: Infested, kill me myself. M: You ask me to pity –

It is good, it is killed. I have no more, my grief, which I would offer you. 

Alleviate the swollen light from here, ungrateful Jason. You know your wife? 

such I am accustomed to flight. A road opens to the heaven: 

the twin serpents offer their scaly necks, lowered to the yoke.

Receive your sons now, parent; I shall be carried among the air by a winged chariot. 

I: Go, up aloft, through the high space of heaven. Bear witness that wherever you are carried, there are no gods.

## Epistulae Morales

### 1–2: About your reading habits...

Out of these which you write to me, and out of these which I hear, I conceive good hope of you: you do not run off [discurris] nor be restless by the change of places. Such restlessness is of sick mind. I think that the first argument of a composed mind is able to pause and delay with itself. 

However, see to it, so that reading of many authors and of every genre would not have some chapters vague and unstable. It is fitting to delay in and to be nourished by certain natural talents, if you wish to derive (lit. drag) something which would sit in your mind faithfully. He is nowhere who is everywhere. This happens to life?? in the expelling traveling, so that he would have many entertainments, but no friendships. It is necessary that the same thing happens to these people, who on friendly terms, apply themselves to the intelligence of no one, but hastily and hurrying, go across all matters. 

### 3–4: Watch your "diet"

Food is not useful, nor does it approach the body, which, consumed, leaves the stomach immediately; nothing impedes health as much as the repeated changing of medicines. The wound does come to the scar in which the drugs are tried; no plants grow strong which are often moved; nothing to such a degree is used so that it is helpful in transition. The multitude of books distracts; Therefore when you are not able to read the amount you have, it is enough to have the amount which you read. "But often", you ask, "I wish to read this book, often another (that one)." It is the role of a destaining stomach to taste too much; those when they are varied and diverse, pollute rather than nourish. Therefore, always read the approved (works), and if it is ever pleasing to be diverted to others, return to the prior ones. Every day, prepare something against poverty, some of the help??? against death, and no less against other calamity; and when you run through many things, pick out one which you cook up during that day. 

### 5–6: Be happy with little

I myself, at least, do this; I cling to something out of the many things I read. Every day, this is what I obtained from Epicurus (for I am also accustomed to cross over into the foreign camp, not as a refugee, but as an explorer): "Honest (respected) poverty", he says, "is a happy thing." That truly is not poverty, if it is happy; he who does not have too little, but wishes for too much, is poor. For what matters how much is in the money box to him, how much lies in the store house, and how many animals he shepherd, or how much interest he loans out, if he is eager for another's wealth, if he thinks not about the things he acquired, but those which is to be acquired? You ask what is the mode/limit of wealth? First, have what is necessary, and following that, have what is enough. Farewell. 

### 40.1: our letters unite us

Seneca greets Lucilius himself???

I give thanks to the fact that you write to me frequently. For, in this one manner, you are able to reveal (show) yourself to me. Never do I accept your letter with the result that we are not immediately together (become one). If the images of the absent friends are pleasing to us, which restore (renew) the memory and lift the desire from false (fake) and empty solace, how much more pleasant the letters are, which carries the true trace of the absent friend to the true known things? ???

For that which is most sweet in the view, to recognize that which the hand of the friend impressed upon the letter. ???

### 49.1–3: Memories triggered by a visit to Pompeii

Seneca greets Lucilius himself???

Indeed, my Lucilius, he is passive and negligent who is led back from another region into the memory of a friend, having been warned (admonished); however, the familiar places evoke the remote desire in our mind in the meantime???, nor do they lead back the extinguished??? memory, but arouse the inactivated (quiet), as the grief of the crying, even if it is softened by time either a young slave of the family of the lost one, or clothes, or the house restores (the memory). Behold Campania and especially the view of Naples and your Pompeii [incredibile???] in how they make recent desire of yours: you as a whole is in my eyes (lit. in the eyes to me). At once I depart from you; I see you, drinking your tears completely, and among the very restraint, resisting your leaving affections. I seem to have lost you just now; for what is not "just now", if you call (them) to mind? Just now, I sat as a boy among my father the philosopher, just now I started to argue cases, and just now I ceased to want to argue, and just now ceased to be able to. The speed of time is infinite, which is more apparent to those who look back. For it tricks the ones who focus on the the present; precisely, the passage of headlong flight is light???. You ask for the cause of this matter? Whatever portion of time is in the same location; equally it appears, lies together; all things fall in the same depth... ???

### 55.1–2: A "stroll" along the seashore

I come at once by a carrying (basket???), no lest weary than if I had walked than (as much as???) I sat. For it is a labor and for a long time to bring, and perhaps because it is against nature [eo maior???]. which gives (us) feet so that we would walk through ourselves, eyes so that we would see through ourselves. Delight proclaimed debilitation to us, and what we are unwilling to do for a long time, we cease to be able to do them. However, It was necessary for me to shake my body, so that, whether the bile has settled in my throat, they would be shattered, or if my breath itself, out of some reason, was denser, the shake would diminish that, which I heard to have been useful to me. Therefore, for a long time I persisted to be dragged in that very challenging seashore, which curves between Cumae and the villa of Servilus Vatia and here to the sea???, and from there as if a narrow road closed by the lake...

### 3–5: But was it life? 

However, out of my custom I started to look around whether I would discover something in that place, which is able to be good to me, and I directed my eyes to the villa, which once Vatia was (lived in). In this villa, he, a praetorian rich man???, known by no other thing than leisure, grew old, and he is considered fortunate on account of this one (matter)... People cry: "O Vatia, you alone know (how) to live." But that man used to know how to lie hidden, not to live; however, it makes much difference whether your life is full of leasure or cowardly. I never used to pass by this villa, with Vatia living, otherwise than to say???: "Vatia is situated here." But, my Lucilius, it is something so sacred and venerable so that even if anything is similar to it, it would please falsefully. For vulgar (common) people think that a secluded person is in leisure, and is untroubled and content with himself, living for himself, of all these nothing would be connected to anyone, unless it is able to be to the wise???. That person alone knows how to live for himself; for he, which is the first???, knows to live. For he who flees from (wordly) matters and people, whom unhappiness of his own desire has banished, who was not able to live more happily???, who, as if a timid and helpless animal concealed itself due to fear, he did not live for himself, but, that which is the most shameful, to his stomach, sleep, and lust; he did not live for himself continuously, who??? lives for no one. However, such great a thing is constancy, and perseverence in his own intention so that he would have the authority as well as perserving idleness.

### 8–11: You're right here, Lucilius!

But the place does not bring about much for the purpose of tranquility: the mind is which??? recommend everything to himself. I saw in the cheerful and attractive villa the grim things, I saw in the middle of solitude the likes (of him), occupied. Therefore, there is no reason that you think you are, for that reason, less well placed since you are not in Campania.Why, however, are you not? Send your thoughts all the way to here. It is allowed to live with friends being absent, and truly, as often as you wish, as long as you would like... 

A friend must be possessed by the mind; here, moreover, it is never absent; whatever he wishes, he sees everyday. Therefore, study with me, eat with me, walk with me: we used to live in the narrow, if anything had been closed from??? thinking. I see you, my Lucili; immediately I hear you; such I am with you, so that I do not deliberate and start letters, but I write (infinitive scribere???) little notes to you. Farewell.

## De Amicitia: A technique for keeping an absent friend in mind

One travel erases all duty from the mind; if truly this is longer, and more remote, also parishes the recognition (memory). not only friendship. So that this is not able to happen, we shall resist with all the help, and lead back the fleeing memory. The remarkable image is portrayed by the mind and out of the sought life, not vanishing and silent. "Such he used to carry his hands, and such his face": we add to him which more pertain to the matter: such he used to speak, such he used to encourage, such he used to frighten, such he used to be free in giving plan, and easy in receiving it, not perserving in change; such he was accustomed to gladly offer his kindness (help), and give up with toleration, such his kindness used to hurry ; such he used to become angry, and with that face he was conquered by his friend, with which others are used to conquer: we wander through other virtues, in the use and handling of these we dwell.
