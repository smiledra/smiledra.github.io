## About me

I am interested in how people perceive and learn about the world. Within this frame, I have been studying speech as a particular medium, and examining how people learn, use, and represent speech in their brain. Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, with affiliations in NACS ([Neuroscience and Cognitive Science](nacs.umd.edu)), the Department of Linguistics, and the Department of Computer Science (which I am working on a Master's Degree in).

I am also a piano-player who plays what I love like a broken record. Other than performing, I also enjoy studying theories of music and Music History, occasionally composing parodies of the old time. I take music not as a career but very seriously, because as Seneca says:

> Mihi crede, verum gaudium res severa est. (Sen. *Ep.* 23.4)

Chronologically, I am from Kunming, a city in *Southwest* China. Intriguingly, the official dialect of Kunming is a *Northern* dialect, with close relation to standard Mandarin. [Here](/research/LIN210_projectPaper_LL.pdf) is a little project on my hometown dialect. I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2020, with a degree in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (B.S.) and another in Linguistics (B.A.).

## Research Interest

Broadly, I am interested about human perception and cognition. Among all the things humans perceive and think about, I have mostly been focusing on speech. Speech is something we do effortlessly but unique to humans, and something that machine learning tries hard to approach human performance. How do we do this? In my PhD, I focus on speech rhythm --- temporal regularities of sounds --- and examine how speech rhythm is represented by the human brain. I use a very interdisciplinary research, from phonology and music psychology to machine learning and time series analysis, to study how speech rhythm is represented in the brain and learned as we acquire our native language.
