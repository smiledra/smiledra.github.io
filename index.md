## About me

I am interested in how people perceive and learn about the world. Within this frame, I have been studying speech as a particular medium, and examining how people learn, use, and represent speech in their brain. Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, with affiliations in NACS ([Neuroscience and Cognitive Science](https://nacs.umd.edu)), the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.umd.edu), and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu)/UMIACS (which I am working on a Master's Degree in).

I am also a pianist who plays what I love like a broken record. Other than performing, I also enjoy studying theories of music and music history, occasionally composing in the old style. I take music not as a career but very seriously, because as Seneca says:

> Mihi crede, verum gaudium res severa est. (Sen. *Ep.* 23.4)

Chronologically, I am from Kunming, a city in *Southwest* China. Intriguingly, the main dialect of Kunming is a *Northern* dialect, with close relation to standard Mandarin. [Here](/research/LIN210_projectPaper_LL.pdf) is a little project on my hometown dialect. I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2020, with a degree in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (B.S.) and another in Linguistics (B.A.).

## Research Interest

Broadly, I am interested in human perception and cognition. Among all the things humans perceive and think about, I have mostly been focusing on speech. Speech is something we perceive and use effortlessly but is unique to humans. It is also something that machine learning tries hard to match human performance on. How do we do this? In my PhD, I focus on speech rhythm --- temporal regularities of sounds --- and examine how speech rhythm is represented by the human brain. I use a interdisciplinary approach, from phonology and music psychology to machine learning and time series analysis, to study how speech rhythm is represented in the brain and learned as we acquire our native language.
