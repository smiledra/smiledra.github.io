## About me

I am interested in simulating how people perceive and learn about the world. Within this frame, I have been studying auditory perception and processing as a particular medium, and examining how people learn, use, and represent speech in their brain.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, with affiliations in NACS ([Neuroscience and Cognitive Science](https://nacs.umd.edu)), the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu), and the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.umd.edu). My advisors are Drs. Naomi Feldman and Ramani Duraiswami. I also pursued a MS degree in Computer Science concurrently with my PhD in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science.

Aside from research, I am a pianist who plays what I love like a broken record. Other than performing, I enjoy studying theories of music and music history, occasionally composing in the old style. I take music not as a career but very seriously, because as Seneca says:

> Mihi crede, verum gaudium res severa est. (Sen. *Ep.* 23.4)

Chronologically, I am from Kunming, a city in *Southwest* China. Intriguingly, the main dialect of Kunming is a *Northern* dialect, with close relation to standard Mandarin. [Here](/research/LIN210_projectPaper_LL.pdf) is a little project on my hometown dialect. I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2020, with a degree in Brain & Cognitive Sciences (B.S.) and another in Linguistics (B.A.).
